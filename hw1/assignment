• implement hash tables with insert and find
 − with linked-list buckets [1pt]
 − with linear probing and rehashing [1pt]
• compare with std::set and std::unordered_set [1pt]
• bonus: beat std::unordered_set by >10 % [.5pt]
• stick to crude measurement methods: time(1)/clock(3)
• use a number of elements suitable for this measurement style
